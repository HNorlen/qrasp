# Qrasp - Three qubit Qiskit user interface on Raspberry PI SenseHat
A set of Python scripts that uses Qiskit to run three qubit quantum circuits and display the results as bar graphs on a Raspberry PI SenseHat 8x8 LED display.

Qrasp consists of the following scripts:
1. main_controller.py  
This script loads the required libraries, and uses the SenseHat joystick to 
- 3 qubit entangled
- 2 qubit entangled
-  etc.
